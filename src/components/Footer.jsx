              Disclosure â€” In order to grow our small business, Cup of Jo earns
              revenue in a few different ways. We publish several sponsored
              posts each month, which are always labeled at the top. We also
              sometimes earn an affiliate commission on the sales of products we
              link to. We feature only items we genuinely love and want to
              share, and this is an arrangement between the retailer and Cup of
              Jo (readers never pay more for products). These are the ways we
              support Cup of Jo, and allow us to run the site and engage with
              this community we truly love. Thank you for reading!
